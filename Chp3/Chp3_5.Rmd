# 3. Working Basis
### 3.5 Exercise

1. Why does this code not work?

```{r e1}
#> Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'my_varıable' not found
my_variable <- 10
my_variable #> var name error: my_varıable
```
Look carefully! (This may seem like an exercise in pointlessness, but training your brain to notice even the tiniest difference will pay off when programming.)

2. Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:


```{r e2}
library("tidyverse")

ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

3. Press Option + Shift + K / Alt + Shift + K. What happens? How can you get to the same place using the menus?

```{r e3}
# key board shortcut quick reference
```
